# fortran-random-number-generator
This repository contains an implementation of a random number generator in Fortran. The generator uses an XOR-Shift algorithm to produce high-quality random numbers with fast generation speed. It includes a set of tests to evaluate the quality of the generator, including correlation assessment and other statistical tests.
